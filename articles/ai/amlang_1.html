              The next article in this series will describe
              how <a href="https://github.com/Khouderchah-Alex/amlang">Amlang</a>
              is both a database for a language and a language for a database,
              and more broadly how it's an intersection of language, database,
              and simulation systems. At the heart of this matter&#8213;and one
              of the distinguishing characteristics of Amlang&#8213;is the
              Environment. It's highly recommended to have
              read <a href="./amlang_0.html">Part 0: Background</a> of this
              series before reading this part.

            <h3 class="section-heading text-center">S-Exps and Lisp</h3>
            <p class="text-article">
              An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>
              is either a primitive (e.g. integer, string, array, hash table,
              etc), or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons
              cell</a> (an ordered pair of
              S-expression <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)">references</a>,
              where the first and second elements are
              called <keyword>car</keyword> and <keyword>cdr</keyword>,
              respectively). We can apply this definition recursively and see
              that S-exps can represent
              any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree">binary
              tree</a>. In
              most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisps</a>,
              S-exps can also be used to represent
              certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)">cyclic
              graphs</a>, but S-exps in Amlang can only represent binary trees
              (i.e. cons cells in Amlang have unique ownership of their car &
              cdr).
            </p>

            <p class="text-article">
              From this perspective, cons cells are a means of gluing together
              component S-exps. Importantly, as an ordered pair of references to
              component S-exps, this glue only works in one direction. From the
              perspective of a cons cell, there is some relation between its
              component S-exps, but from the perspective of either of the
              components, there is no obvious link between it and the other
              component. This also means that cons cells allow for building on
              top of existing components without needing to modify or move them.
            </p>
            <img class="img-main" src="../../img/articles/cons_perspective.png" alt="Cons perspective" width="65%">
            <p class="text-caption">Figure 1: On the left, we can see the link between A & B. On the right, we cannot.</p>
            <p class="text-article"></p>

            <p class="text-article">
              In addition, cons cells can be connected in different
              configurations in order to glue together more than just two
              components. However, because the components themselves may also be
              cons cells, the "viewer" must already know the structure of the
              glue (how the top-level cons cells are configured) in order to
              distinguish the glue from the components being glued. Indeed,
              there isn't inherently one way to distinguish between the glue and
              the components; an S-exp can be seen as an atomic unit or as
              various configurations and levels of glue & components.
            </p>

            <p class="text-article">
              We can construct the idea of a <keyword>list</keyword> as a series
              of cons cells where the car is an element of the list and the cdr
              is either another cons or a special terminating value of NIL. In
              this way, we can "glue" an arbitrary and extendible number of
              components together while still knowing what's glue and what
              isn't. Textually, we represent a single cons of A & B
              as <code class="prettyprint">(A . B)</code> and shorten a list's
              textual representation from <code class="prettyprint">(A . (B . (C
              . NIL)))</code> to <code class="prettyprint">(A B C)</code>. Look
              at how the text and structure
              of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression#/media/File:Corrected_S-expression_tree_2.svg">this
              S-exp</a> compare. By extending the notion of lists to
              include <keyword>improper lists</keyword>, which terminate with an
              arbitrary S-exp rather than NIL (written
              as <code class="prettyprint">(A B C . D)</code>), we can represent
              all S-exps as lists of S-exps (in many Lisps, this can be used to
              create cycles by D being a reference to an earlier part of the
              S-exp). Continuing with the idea of looking at S-exps in different
              ways, this means we can consider an S-exp as either a primitive or
              cons, or as a primitive or list. In a
              sense, <code class="prettyprint">(A . (B . (C . D)))</code>
              and <code class="prettyprint">(A B C . D)</code> textually
              represent these two views.
              </p>

            <p class="text-article">
              Lisps represent not only "normal data", but also Lisp code itself
              as S-exps (making the
              languages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconic</a>).
              The default expectation of a Lisp interpreter is for code to be a
              list where, when all elements are evaluated individually, the
              first element is a function and remaining elements are function
              arguments; take a look at <code class="prettyprint">(* (+ 1 2) (+
              3 4) 5)</code>. Indeed, the name "Lisp" stands for "list
              processor" and comes from this view of the interpreter. "Syntax"
              is any deviation from using plain lists to distinguish between
              glue and components (like <code class="prettyprint">(let ((NAME1
              VAL1) (NAME2 VAL2) ...) INNER_CODE)</code>), and "special forms"
              are syntax + associated special processing rules
              (in <code class="prettyprint">(if PREDICATE A B)</code>, only one
              of A or B should be evaluated).
            </p>

            <p class="text-article">
              In a sense, even the data and code created by Lisp programmers are
              just syntax and special form processing within their own contexts.
              The interface of a function is a model of specific computation,
              where the function name (say, "geometric-mean") represents this
              limited context of specific computation. The Lisp language just
              happens to be a built-in, top-level set of syntax and special
              forms that&#8213;as with all general-purpose languages&#8213;acts
              as both a model and metamodel of code (i.e. allows both for the
              creation of code according to the built-in model of computation,
              and for the creation of new models of computation using the
              built-in model of computation). This is a useful model
              of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing
              completeness</a>. Since
              a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine">Universal
              Turing machine</a> can simulate any Turing machine, its input
              represents a model
              of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursively_enumerable_language">recursively
              enumerable languages</a>; since the Turing machine being simulated
              may itself be a different Universal Turing machine, all Universal
              Turing machines (and all Turing-complete models of computation)
              can act as both models <b>and</b> metamodels of recursively
              enumerable languages. A Turing machine which is not universal
              <b>may</b> still permit some limited form of metamodeling (whether
              as a general metamodel for a grammar type higher in
              the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">Chomsky
              hierarchy</a> or as a more limited kind of metamodel), or it may
              indeed be only usable as a direct model of computation.
            </p>

              <p class="text-article text-no-bottom">
                A useful model of developing
                an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)">exploit</a>
                is as finding a way to use a component's model of specific
                computation (i.e. its interface) as a metamodel that can be used
                to produce different types of computation than the component was
                designed for. In this sense, a key aspect of secure programming
                is reducing the ability for models of computation to
                inadvertently serve as metamodels of computation. However, while
                some exploits may directly use an interface as a metamodel
                (think of a really
                straightforward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection">code

                This relates to the fact that "hacker" tends to be used both in
                a general sense and in more specific manner. The broader sense
                of "hacker" is someone who uses computers (or more broadly any
                tool) to achieve novel and clever outcomes, and often approaches
                the task with a sense of curiosity and exploration. Apathy,
                disinterest, or belief that most interesting problems have
                already been solved are ethoses most antithetical to the hacker
                mindset. The general term of "hacker" can be put into
                perspective by recognizing that the language system being used
                (whether processor, interpreter, compiler, or some
                combination/tower) is likely general and explicitly designed to
                be both model and metamodel of computation. By focusing instead
                on systems that explicitly try <b>not</b> to behave as

                From the above discussion, we can see that the genesis of
                "hacking" in the more limited & popular sense of the word is
                exploitation. However, out of the seed of exploitation has grown
                the vast fields of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare&#8213;covering
                such topics as reconnaissance, post-exploitation, stealth, social

                considerations. On the other hand, without an understanding of
                exploitation, the tapestry of cybersecurity will always seem
                vague and nebulous, with dogma serving to obscure this

              An important note is that representing Lisp code as S-exps does
              not mean Lisp code <b>must</b> be S-exps. In modern
              Lisps, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a>
              is achieved through the use
              of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)#Syntactic_macros">macros</a>&#8213;which
              treat their input (Lisp code) as S-exps and can modify them how
              they like&#8213;but must be evaluated by a certain point in the
              "compilation" of the code. After this stage, the language system
              can compile down
              into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode">bytecode</a>
              or machine code like any other language. What the S-exp
              representation of Lisp code enables is the use of Lisp to create &
              modify Lisp in an elegant manner that clearly reflects normal Lisp
              programming (although metaprogramming inherently demands higher
              cognitive load), whereas other languages tend to use either a
              different metaprogramming language (e.g. C macros, C++ templates,
              Rust macro_rules), the same language in a different context that
              requires much specialized knowledge (e.g. Rust procedural macros),
              or the same language in a greatly constrained context (e.g. C++
              constexpr, Rust const). Prior to the use of macros for
              metaprogramming, early Lisps
              used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fexpr">fexpr</a>,
              which is similar to macros but can be used for metaprogramming at
              any point in runtime rather than only during compile-time.
              Nowadays, fexpr-like features tend to be associated with highly
              reflective systems like 3-Lisp rather than mainstream language
              systems. With that said, even fexpr-like behavior does not mandate
              a permanent S-exp representation of code; if any representation of
              some code (whether
              persisted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">IR</a>,
              a final compiled representation, or a mix of both) can reproduce
              an S-exp representation on-demand, that code can be applied to an
              fexpr without needing to always be an S-exp.
            </p>

            <p class="text-article text-no-bottom">
              Before we end our tour of S-exps, note that the "S" in "S-exp"
              stands for symbolic. That is, traditionally S-exps have been used
              in contexts (like Lisps)
              where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(programming)">symbols</a>&#8213;as
              a unique ID and an associated name&#8213;played a key role in
              their use (i.e. where the language system centers meaning
              around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table">symbol
              tables</a>). From the author's perspective, this has long been a
              limitation of Lisps because symbols are tailored towards human
              users rather than the language system itself. Humans dictating the
              behavior of a software system does not preclude the use of
              software in achieving that goal; in fact, it is the very nature of
              language systems to be software which creates software, and a lens
              of AI is as the logical conclusion of this path. From this
              perspective, symbols as ID + name are a limitation because the
              semantics & semantical context of the associated name are implicit
              to the language system. This is especially true because symbols
              tend to be connected through their names&#8213;which hides those
              connections from the language system (e.g. how are
              "arithmetic-mean" and "geometric-mean" related, or "ReplicaSet"
              and "Pod"?)&#8213;and because symbols actually encapsulate
              important semantics. If we could arbitrarily change symbol names
              without changing the meaning of the code (considering not only
              execution of final, "compiled" representations, but also the
              process of creating/modifying that code), the above points
              wouldn't quite matter. Note that none of this is an argument
              against the use of symbols, but rather an argument against using
              symbols as fundamental to a language system rather than as a
              convenience for humans.

            <p class="text-article">
              Let's begin by considering
              a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>
              as a set of vertices (also called nodes), and a set of edges
              (ordered or unordered pairs of vertices). Graphs use local
              connections to produce global structures of incredible variety,
              and are the central model upon
              which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph
              theory</a>
              and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science">network
              science</a> are built. Graphs can also be used to represent
              knowledge/information, which is the purview
              of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph
              databases</a>. However, when representing information, we are
              often not only concerned with <b>whether</b> two
              nodes/concepts/models/etc are connected, but also <b>how</b> they
              are connected. This leads us to extending the idea of an edge from
              a pair of nodes to a <keyword>triple</keyword> of nodes, where the
              middle node represents the edge itself (i.e. the context by which
              the other two nodes are connected). By convention, the three
              components of a semantic triple are referred to as subject,
              predicate, and object, although it's not necessary for semantic
              triples to abide by human-language grammatical rules. A graph
              database based on the idea of semantic triples is called
              a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">triplestore</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="text-article">
              This idea of taking graphs
              and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(knowledge_representation)">reifying</a>
              edges produces a structure we call a <keyword>metagraph</keyword>,
              which&#8213;compared to a regular graph&#8213;can create edges
              between a vertex and edge, and between edges. Indeed there is no
              longer a clear distinction between what was before vertex and
              edge. For example, in <code class="prettyprint">(antonym antonym
              synonym)</code>, antonym acts as both "vertex" and "edge". It's
              worth noting that we could contrive various manners of "compiling
              down" a triplestore into a database implemented with edges rather
              than triples (i.e. the systems
              have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisimulation">bisimulation</a>).
              This allows for graph theory to still be relevant (think
              of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics">denotational
              semantics</a>), but different implementations would excel at very
              different kinds of workloads.

            <p class="text-article">
              As a first approximation, we could look at the Environment as a
              metagraph where Nodes may contain Structures (S-exps). In a sense,
              a Node containing a Structure is an abstraction of the Structure,
              like symbols are in Lisps. A Node containing a Structure is
              referred to as <keyword>structured</keyword>, and is
              otherwise <keyword>atomic</keyword>. Nodes are one of the key
              primitives of the process
              of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>
              in Amlang; any Structure&#8213;or even a vague concept with no
              associated Structure&#8213;can be inserted into an Environment,
              and the resulting Node may then be used to refer to that
              Structure/concept. Importantly, Nodes are also one of the S-exp
              primitives in Amlang, meaning that Structures may themselves
              contain Nodes. It's in this way that Amlang S-exps may represent
              cycles despite their base Structure being inherently non-cyclic.
              Note that Nodes don't necessarily have any one "meaning", and the
              fact that a Node is discrete does not necessitate that the meaning
              it abstracts is a discrete or formal concept (like how the
              discrete outputs of
              a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifier</a>
              don't imply formal, axiomatic concepts, but rather fuzzy,
              statistical ones). We must defer further pursuit of the idea of
              "meaning" to the next article in this series, on Agents.
            </p>

            <p class="text-article">
              In this way, Nodes can be parts of the metagraph&#8213;connected
              by triples&#8213;or parts of Structures within or external to the
              metagraph, connected by cons cells or any aggregate primitive
              types (arrays, hash tables, etc). Since the Structures within the
              metagraph may themselves refer to different parts of the
              metagraph, the result is less like a plane of triple-connected
              nodes containing isolated Structures, and more like a spherical
              shell of triple-connected nodes that are internally interconnected
              by Structures built on top of each other (just an analogy of
              course; the metagraph alone need not
              be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph">planar</a>).
              We thus refer to the Environment as a <keyword>structured
              metagraph</keyword>.
            </p>

            <p class="text-article">
              Finally, triples in the Environment are also a kind of Node.
              Conceptually, one can think of triples as a specific kind of
              structured Node, whose Structure is treated specially by the
              underlying Amlang implementation and
              the <a href="https://github.com/Khouderchah-Alex/amlang/blob/master/src/environment/environment.rs#L18">Environment
              interface</a>. With triples as Nodes, we can make triples about
              triples, like <code class="prettyprint">((Earth is flat)
              provenance random-blogger-27)</code>. In a sense, making triples a
              kind of Node provides a recursive step for reifying the graph
              structure, where moving from edges to triples was a base step in
              reifying the graph structure. To put in another way, to the degree
              that triples represent knowledge (whether through local
              connections alone or global structure holistically) reifying
              triples as Nodes allows for knowledge-about-knowledge, both in the
              form of Structure and metagraph. This same reification could be
              achieved just by making edges (pairs) as a kind of Node, but as
              stated earlier, triples are a more convenient model when we care
              not only about whether Nodes are related but also about how.

              line of bytes in a hard drive as a directory structure (a

              core of what an OS kernel is, with drivers to take care of the

              nature of all language systems, there has historically been
              something of a bifurcation in the field of study and industry,
              where remodeling computation is seen as more the purview of
              programming languages and remodeling storage as more the purview
              of database systems. This bifurcation might be justified by
              viewing the focus of databases as data scale and querying within

              particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model">consistency

              in mainstream software development, it was possible to skirt
              issues of consistency within a programming language and use
              databases as the provider of consistency when necessary (think

              languages needing sane and standardized consistency models
              however, we will argue in the next article that bifurcating
              language systems into programming languages and databases is
              unproductive and causes problems for developing the field of
              language systems.

              Triples and cons cells are both a form of glue between components.
              In triples, the components being glued are always Nodes (although
              the Nodes may be structured), whereas cons cells glue together
              Structures (although the Structures might be or contain Nodes). As
              discussed in the earlier section on S-exps, cons cells are a
              uni-directional relation; only from the perspective of the cons
              does the relation exist. On the other hand, triples are a
              quad-directional relation, where the relation is available from
              subject, predicate, object, and triple itself. This would be a
              tri-directional relation if triples weren't reified in the
              Environment; the triple direction is essentially in the direction
              of meta-knowledge.

              bytes. One might consider how the flexible process of prototyping
              a class's interface and members in source code compiles down into
              an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">array
              of function pointers</a>
              and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment">array
              of members & padding</a> as part of the ABI, or how the relational
              model of data requires developers to mentally "compile down" their
              data model into arrays. A key principle of Amlang is the ability
              to both collapse and reproduce the context that provides semantics
              for a particular Structure&#8213;whether in metagraph, S-exp, or
              array&#8213;although we defer this to the next article.

              Since machine code represents code & data as bytes in an array,
              and since memory is byte-addressable, machine code has an inherent
              ability to be abstracted by using the address of code/data as its
              "node" (although where the structure of that "node" ends is still
              implicit). This is an ability to abstract that is fundamental
              to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von
              Neumann architecture</a>. In the move to high-level languages, the
              unit of abstraction tends to change; we may only abstract what the
              language system allows us to abstract
              (so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen">first-class
              citizens</a> of the language). A language might make basic data
              types, functions, objects, and classes first-class, but in most
              languages, the degree to which code itself can be abstracted is
              limited to functions. In Lisps, the S-exp representation of code
              allows for code to be abstracted, but often only at a particular
              point in the journey from source to target code and still in a
              rather limited manner. Gadgets, as mentioned in the aside on
              exploitation, are an example of recovering the more general
              abstractive capabilities of the processor from under the language
              system's feet (although in a context where we don't want
              generality). Note that preventing S-exps from directly
              representing cycles imposes a requirement that cyclic structures
              are always abstracted in the metagraph.

              We briefly note that there is no limitation to have only one
              Environment in Amlang. Any semantic boundary can be applied to a
              particular Environment, whether analogous
              to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(database)">database
              partitions</a>, permission boundaries, task segregation, etc.
              Currently, there is a top-level Environment called the Meta
              Environment, which represents the relations between different
              Environments and allows both the base Amlang system and
              (presumably privileged) user systems to interact with, compare,
              and interrelate different Environments.

              This article described Environment as a structured
              metagraph&#8213;an interrelation of triplestore and S-exp-like
              Structure&#8213;using Nodes as the bridge between these quad- and
              uni-directional models of storage. While this idea may seem
              interesting, Environments truly come to life only when we add
              Agents, which is the topic of the next article in this series.
